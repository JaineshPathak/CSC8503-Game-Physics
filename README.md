# CSC8503 Goat Imitator
The job was to make a prototype game similar to Goat Simulator. The focus of this project was to demonstrate game physics, raycasting, collision detection constraints, artificial intelligence using A* path finding and state machines.

â€‹I implemented the player movement, AI both friendly and evil NPCs and a Spring Constraint - when the goat/player gets a temporary Grapple powerup and can use it for rope physics.

# Source code to look at
The main Source codes I have written is in "CSC8503" folder with files starting with CW* as prefix.

# How to run game
- Go to x64 folder > Release folder > CSC8503.exe
